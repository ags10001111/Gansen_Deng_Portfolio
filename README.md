# 👋 Hi, I'm Gansen!

I am a **PhD in Statistics**. My PhD research focused on developing statistical learning methods for self-reported data, with applications to chronic pain research. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in **statistical theory**, **machine learning**, and **data analysis**—skills I’m excited to apply to real-world challenges in industry.

Throughout my research, I’ve worked on:
- 🧠 **Clustering** and **metric learning**
- 🏷️ **Multi-label classification**
- 🔬 Simulation studies and modeling with complex error structures
- 📊 Working with noisy, self-reported, and high-dimensional data

These experiences have sharpened my analytical thinking and programming proficiency in languages such as **R** and **Python**.

I’m passionate about turning data into actionable knowledge and building models that support better decision-making.
